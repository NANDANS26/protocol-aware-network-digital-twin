An enterprise-grade, high-performance platform for network protocol analysis, stateful connection tracking, evidence-based topology reconstruction, versioned digital twinning, deterministic formal verification, isolated protocol fuzzing, and predictive network world modeling.

---

## 1. Product Mission & Long-Term Architecture

The platform provides a unified system combining low-latency systems software with formal methods:

1. **High-Performance C++20 Protocol Analysis Engine**: Zero-copy packet parsing across physical and virtual network interfaces.
2. **Protocol-Aware Flow & Connection-State Tracking**: Stateful TCP/UDP connection reconstruction and reassembly.
3. **Evidence-Based Network Topology Reconstruction**: Automated Layer-2 and Layer-3 host and interface discovery from observed traffic.
4. **Versioned Network Digital Twin**: Immutable state graph tracking network changes, device states, and active routes.
5. **Deterministic Security-Property Verification**: Formal invariant checking and automated counterexample generation.
6. **Counterfactual Network Simulation**: Predictive "what-if" testing on digital twin snapshots prior to change execution.
7. **Isolated Protocol Fuzzing & Differential Testing**: Deep parser verification, metamorphic testing, and automated delta minimization.
8. **Stateful Protocol Sequence Testing**: Multi-packet state-machine fuzzing, TCP transition checking, and differential testing.
9. **Predictive Network World Model**: Time-windowed feature extraction, baseline comparison, 90% conformal uncertainty intervals, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) distance gating, and deterministic ground-truth supremacy consensus.
10. **Professional React Engineering Workstation**: High-density dark engineering visual shell, predictive workbench, and telemetry cockpit.

## 2. Current Implementation Status (Phase 06 Operational)

Phase 06 introduces a learned predictive network world model operating alongside deterministic verification:

- **Versioned Feature Extraction Pipeline**: Zero-leakage time-windowed numeric feature extraction from flows, packets, and topology snapshots without raw payload retention.
- **Baseline Comparison & Calibrated Models**: Persistence and Moving Average baseline models evaluated against Ridge, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models on future prediction targets.
- **Empirical 90% Conformal Uncertainty Intervals**: Conformal calibration yielding bounded intervals `[lower, upper]` with empirical coverage guarantees.
- **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Distance Gating**: Mahalanobis distance gating classifying predictions as High Reliability, Moderate Uncertainty, or Out-of-Distribution.
- **Scenario Consensus Harmonizer**: Consensus engine joining statistical behavior forecasts with deterministic simulation traces under strict ground-truth supremacy (a learned model never overrides a formal security invariant).
- **Relational Persistence**: SQLite catalog with Schema Migration v5 storing datasets, model artifacts, and prediction records.
- **Predictive World Model REST API**: 10 endpoints under `/api/v1/predictive` for dataset creation, model training, evaluation vs baselines, inference, and scenario evaluation.
- **React Predictive Workbench**: Dedicated workbench tab (`PredictiveWorkbench.tsx`) inside the Network Twin workstation for dataset inspection, model comparison, live calibrated inference, scenario consensus, and methodological rules.
- **Full Automated Quality Gates**: 149 pytest tests, 26 vitest tests, 100% C++ engine tests, strict TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit`), and Ruff linting passing cleanly.

## 7. Next Implementation Target: Phase 01

With the Phase 00 foundation complete and verified, the exact next step is **Phase 01**:
- Full PCAP / PCAPNG parser implementation in `PcapFilePacketSource`.
- Zero-copy protocol decoders (Ethernet, 802.1Q, IPv4, IPv6, ARP, TCP, UDP, ICMP).
- Stateful bidirectional flow correlation (canonical 5-tuple hash) and TCP state machine tracking.
- High-throughput streaming IPC bridge between `protocol_engine` and Python control plane.
